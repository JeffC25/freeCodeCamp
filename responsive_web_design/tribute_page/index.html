        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>2003</strong> - Born in St. Paul, Minnesota
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - Learned to ride a bike
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - "at the age of 10 i went to a community center to do karate and afterwards i went with a friend to the park nearby and the path to it was on a very, and i mean very steep hill. we wanted to race down which we did. as i ran down the hill, this hill was on a 45 maybe more degree angle, i speed up so fast that i was basically falling and my feet did nothing to propel me forward and only ensured that i didnt fall on my face. As i approaced the bottom of the hill i didnt have a way to stop and i freaked out and tripped near the bottom and ate shit and tumbled down the rest of the way. surprisingly i didnt break anything but everything hurt like a bitch for at least a day"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - "another day i got a piece of toilet paper stuck in my ear for no reason. I was attempting to get  it out but i could not and was terrified but didnt tell anyone cause my mom would yell at me. As I am going to my first day of the class one day in middle school i was able to finally get it out and i shit you not that moment was and probablity still is like the top 3 most relieveing moments of my life. I have gotten finals grades back that were good that i was scared i did shit on and the relief i felt for that is miniscule compared to getting the toilet paper out my ear"
